# Oceanic [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/oceanic.js.svg?style=flat-square&color=informational)](https://npmjs.com/package/oceanic.js)
A NodeJS Library for Discord.

<hr>

## Installation
NodeJS **16.16.0** or higher is required.

**Do note we are currently in the alpha stage. Releases will be made when I see fit. See [Development Builds](#development-builds) if you wish to install in-dev versions. (due to the nature of an alpha, bugs are being found all the time, so installing in-dev versions is currently your best bet for being up-to-date)**

```sh
npm i oceanic.js
```

This module is in its early alpha stages. See the `examples` folder on GitHub for some examples, and visit [this site](https://oceanic.owo-whats-this.dev) for documentation.

### Development Builds
```sh
npm i oceanic.js@dev
```

The documentation under `dev` is always for the latest commit. If something isn't working that's in the documentation, you're likely looking at the wrong documentation.

### Optional Dependencies
* `pako` - Compression (gateway)
* `zlib-sync` - Compression (gateway, faster than pako)
